                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed Interpretable-MTLNet, a novel multitask neural architecture combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with multi-scale temporal convolutions to simultaneously detect depression and anxiety from wearable sensor data, achieving 0.731 macro-AUROC on 40,000 participants</li>
                        <li>Created mathematically transparent AI system using spline-based activations that provides clinically interpretable explanations of model decisions through visualizable feature-response curves, maintaining 98.2% of full model accuracy in symbolic surrogate form</li>
                        <li>Demonstrated superior performance over established baselines including CNN-LSTM, Transformer, and gradient-boosted tree models while solving the interpretability-performance trade-off critical for clinical AI deployment and regulatory approval</li>
